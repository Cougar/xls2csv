Revision history for Perl script xls2csv.

1.04 Sun Sep 24
    - After reviewing CPAN Testers reports, I realized that Makefile.PL should be specifying Unicode::Map as a prereq.
        Now it does. Hopefully the test script won't die anymore.

1.03 Sat Sep 24
	- Makefile.PL was requiring perl 5.8.6. This has been lowered to 5.6.0
        - "-v" will now show the version
        - Reading of the spreadsheet will now continue if a blank line is encountered.
        
1.02 Fri Sep 23
        - Now distributed in a much nicer tar.gz package.

1.00 - 1.01  Fri Sep 23
	- original version(s)
		These were uploaded to CPAN as single pl files 
		instead of an installable package..oops.
